To my loving girlfriend and my best friend,
 It's been more than 1.5 years that you started being around me as my roomate then as a friend and now as my girlfriend. Even if i put it as a roller coaster ride would be an understatement.You been my side when i needed , didn't leave me on my own and helped me navigate this new part of my life in a new country. I cant thank you enough for all this. No matter the misunderstandings, screamings and conflicts , to my knowledge it never continued to next day. I know whatever future we'll be having would be even better and hopefully we go all the way. 
 To many more of your birthdays that we celebrate together!!!
