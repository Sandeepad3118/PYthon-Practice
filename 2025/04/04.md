### Set Matrix Zeroes | Brute → Better → Optimal (O(1) Space)

Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.

#### Brute Force Approach (O(mn(m+n)) Time | O(m*n) Space)
Idea:
    Traverse the matrix, and whenever matrix[i][j] == 0, mark its entire row and column with a placeholder (e.g., -1).
    After processing, replace all -1 with 0.

def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    temp = [row[:] for row in matrix]  # Deep copy to avoid overwriting

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if temp[i][j] == 0:
                # Mark entire row and column
                for k in range(m):
                    matrix[k][j] = 0
                for k in range(n):
                    matrix[i][k] = 0

Problems:
    Time Complexity: O(mn(m + n)) → Inefficient for large matrices.
    Space Complexity: O(m*n) (due to deep copy).

#### Better Approach (O(m*n) Time | O(m + n) Space)
Idea:
    Use two arrays (rows and cols) to track which rows/columns need to be zeroed.
    Traverse the matrix once to mark rows/cols containing 0.
    Traverse again to set zeros based on the markers.

def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    rows, cols = [False] * m, [False] * n

    # Step 1: Mark rows and columns to be zeroed
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                rows[i] = True
                cols[j] = True

    # Step 2: Set zeros
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if rows[i] or cols[j]:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

Pros:
    Time: O(m*n) → Efficient.
    Space: O(m + n) → Better than brute force.

#### Optimal Approach (O(m*n) Time | O(1) Space)
Idea:
    Use the first row and first column as markers (instead of extra arrays).
    Special handling for first row/column (since they serve as markers).

Algorithm:
    Check if the first row/column needs to be zeroed (using first_row_zero and first_col_zero).
    Use the first row and column to mark zeros:
        If matrix[i][j] == 0, set matrix[i][0] = 0 and matrix[0][j] = 0.
    Set zeros based on markers (except first row/column).
    Zero out the first row/column if needed.

def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    first_row_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n))
    first_col_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))

    # Step 1: Use first row/column as markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Step 2: Set zeros based on markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Step 3: Zero out first row/column if needed
    if first_row_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
    if first_col_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0

Pros:
    Time: O(m*n) → Efficient.
    Space: O(1) → Best possible.
