## Tasks


## Notes

mannn this is going to get crazy

i have funds till end of june then have to go for work

what i'm thinking is to get my resume and applications sorted and preparation done by that time 
meanwhile applying to jobs together
seems a good option other than 


Talk about where i'm mentally and what's the way forward

today its 2nd may 2025

i started my career as sre/devops position - is it something i loved?  no then got a hang of it.. 
always wanted to be a developer - i didn't put right steps into making it a reality
thought if i wanted to make a switch better path would be to do masters and then check what career does i'm comfortable with then work towards it

but then how can i know which career path is best with ai revamping the industry.. first of all software engineers will always be useful the talented ones(maybe in distant future they have to learn ai things but in general the talented ones will be always be in demand.. keep your basics alright.. today is always better than doing tomrw)

so to apply to jobs in software role i dont have enough exp and knowledge
remember dsa will always be relevant whatever happens !!!

Dont focus on salary... work on increasing the skill as much as possible

Now talking about the sweet spot of how i should go about this from my past 3 months of preparation:
. 




Future what it looks like and preparing :
Key Transformations Underway:

    From Reactive to Proactive Operations: AI enables predictive capabilities that anticipate issues before they occur. SREs are shifting from firefighting to designing systems that prevent outages through machine learning models that analyze historical trends and detect anomalies 13.

    Automation at Scale: Routine tasks like incident triage, log analysis, and even some remediation actions are being automated through AI, allowing engineers to focus on complex system design and reliability patterns 211.

    Intelligent Observability: Traditional monitoring is being replaced by AI-powered observability platforms that can correlate millions of data points across metrics, logs, and traces to surface meaningful insights 34.

    Self-Healing Systems: AI enables infrastructure that can automatically detect and remediate certain classes of issues without human intervention, fundamentally changing the SRE's role in incident management 39.

    Collaboration with Data Science: As AI systems become core to business operations, SREs are working more closely with data scientists to ensure ML models are reliable, performant, and ethically deployed
