## Tasks

## Notes

. Feel stuck in this rut of daily routine
. Dont have clear plan of how to go about life in near future
. Its all about of practice and being curious - question to ask is whether i'm curious enough or think too much about the things that wont add value to my life
. What i'm seeking actually
. Whether i'm on that route consistently. I keep burning out while all the time not doing anything useful.
. Keeping head clear is paramount as its my greatest weapon



Startups exploration

. Finance info
    - splitwise
    - court case
    - bills payments


Plan moving forward:
Go through my resume again. Just focus on applying to 15-20 jobs after clearly checking the job description and fine tuning your resume as per job requirement.
REcap the things mentioned in resume and learn all the things that i've added.
See if you could skill up

. apply to google roles in other parts of world. fine tune it acc to role
. apply to other jobs as well. be good at what you mentioned in resume. trust your skill set. dont be wavering. trust your skills is needed as much as other jobs
. fast track the dsa preparation. also add system design concepts in middle as breather
. mornings are for resume preparation, applying jobs, plan for the day
