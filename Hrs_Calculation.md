so 6th i can work just for 6 hrs
on 8th its 12 hrs as usual

12th sat and 13th sun exchange
12th sat - wake up early
13th - wake up early
```

just 10hrs pure brain energy

10pm- 6pm

6pm - 11(5) (15 min bf break)

11-1 -> break

1-6 -> 5

6-10 -> mix of everything -- take it easy and learn things(other skills)

14 hrs of focus




little tweak:

unfocused -> 3 hrs

sleep around 1 -> 7-8 hrs

Resume Preparation and application to jobs:

. You have SRE resume ready - can apply to various jobs realted to sre
. There's possibility of venturing into devops roles which would open up quite a no of possibilities ( have to learn about of tools and their usage)
. Or you could also focus of dev particularly backend but here i have learn about api's, db's, ...

Date is 26th april 2025
- Waiting for google reply to sre possition - priority 1 if i get good news i can give screening interview around may end or wait another 20 days with updated resume and apply to 3 more roles that are present. in second case too i'm hoping to schedule screeninig interview asap
- Plan B: 
    - Focus on other options and prepare accordingly. Even here i need to focus on dsa and resume preparation & job applications
    - So its reasonable to divide it 70-30
